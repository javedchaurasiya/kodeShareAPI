# kodeShareAPI

A Chrome Extension that currently works for LeetCode through
which we can share and download code by visiting the submission
page.

The Code can also be Commited directly to github.

You can setup the extension locally.

Crrently the extension is not hosted anywhere because to setup
Google dev. account, we need to pay one time charge but sadly
i dont have a visa card.

# Tech. Used

HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, GithubAPI, EJS
